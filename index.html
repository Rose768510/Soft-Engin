                <p>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It ensures software is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.</p>
                <p>Traces back to the 1960s, addressing the "software crisis" by applying rigorous engineering principles.</p>
                <p>Describes the process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. Includes stages like requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>

                <p>Waterfall Model: A linear approach to software development with distinct phases that do not overlap.</p>
                <p>Agile Methodologies: Focus on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration. Examples include Scrum (with sprints and roles like Scrum Master) and Kanban (visualizing work and limiting work-in-progress).</p>
                <p>DevOps Practices: Combine development and operations to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, workflows, and continuously measuring application performance.</p>
